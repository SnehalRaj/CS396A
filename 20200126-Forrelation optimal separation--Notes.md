Inroduction
===========

<!-- Abstract
---------

* Achieved largest possible separation between quantum and classical query complexity using a property testing porblem called forrelation
* The problem is solved with one quantum query where it would require $\Omega(\frac{\sqrt{N}}{logN})$ for any classical randomized algorithm.
* Conversely, showed that 1 vs $\tilde{\Omega(\sqrt(N)}$ separation is optimal
* Any t-query quantum algorithm whatsoever can be simultared by an O(N^{1-\frac{1}{2t}})-query randomized algorithm
* Conjecture: A natural generalization of FORRELATION achieves the optimal t versus $\Omega(N^{1-\frac{1}{2t}})$ separation for all t. -->



Formulas
--------
<!-- It also works withou formulas[^1], but they are simple to use, and they look very beautiful.
$$m = \frac{m_0}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$  -->
<!-- 
[^1]: You dont have to use them if you don't want to. -->

Tables
------
Tables are also possible. And they look awesome.

Definitions
-----------
Lets make some simple definitions - and of course, these can occur everywhere in the document.

Triangle
  <!-- : A plane figure that has three straight bounding sides. There are also triagles with a 90 degree angle: $c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$ -->

Quadrilateral
  : A plane figure that has four straight bounding sides.

Square
  : A rhombus that is a rectangle.
