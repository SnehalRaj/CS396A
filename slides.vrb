\frametitle{Quantum Mechanics}
One of the most basic quantum mechanical systems is a simple 2-state system called the qubit. The qubit is a linear superposition of two states, $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$, which form an orthonormal basis of the qubit space.\\

 We thus write the state of the qubit as $$|\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle$$ where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are called the amplitudes and can be complex numbers in general.\\
 Measuring this qubit must result in one of the basis states, with probability equal to the square of the corresponding amplitude. Thus, we have $$\alpha^2 + \beta^2 = 1.$$
